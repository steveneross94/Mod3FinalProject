# FlatSpace
---
FlatSpace was built as a Single Page Web Application meant to mimic some of the functionality of MySpace. During the Flatiron curriculum, my partner and I wanted to experiment with a music player, and felt this was the best place to start. 

## To Start

Please follow the steps below to ensure the API's are on the proper ports.
